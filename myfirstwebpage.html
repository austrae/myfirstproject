	<h1>Audie the Audacious Maine Coon Cat</h1>
	<p>I have a big, fluffy orange cat named Audie.<br/> His name is Audie because he is audacious, audible, and orange like autumn foliage.<br/> My family adopted him from Standish Humane Society in the late summer of 2015.<br/> For an older cat, he has quite the personality, and he loves to meow.</p>
<p>Audies favourite things are:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Water, specifically from the shower</li>
	<li>People food</li>
	<li>Sleeping on my head</li>
</ul>
<p>I love Audie so much because he:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Is an odd character</li>
	<li>Meows on cue</li>
	<li>Loves me very much</li>
	<li>Is a majestic beast</li>
</ol>
